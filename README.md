This project is to create an AngularJS app using Ionic, to create landing pages for my wife's Photography business, Heather Read Photography & Design.

The goal is to create an application that can spin up landing pages quickly and easily, for Facebook and AdWords campaigns. It will start out simply, and then become more complex as our needs change, so that the project becomes DRY and less hard-coding is required to create a landing page.

Eventually, the final project will be an open-source landing page builder that anybody can easily fork & deploy using gh-pages & Firebase in under 15 minutes.
